# ESP32 Traffic Light Project

********
# Simple Explanation

*******
A traffic light system with an ESP32 microcontroller would involve connecting the ESP32 to a set of LEDs (red, yellow, and green) to simulate a traffic light. 
In this project we will create a traffic light controlled by the ESP32 card where the Red led lights up for 2 seconds, then goes out and the Green led lights up for 2 seconds and then goes out so that the orange led lights up for 2 seconds. Then the program starts over .

# Explanation of connecting LED to ESP32

**********

Connect the LEDs to the ESP32, with the red LED connected to a digital output pin 5, the yellow LED connected to another digital output pin 4, the green LED connected to another digital output pin 16, and the ground to ground pin.
